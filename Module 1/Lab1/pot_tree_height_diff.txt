Problem Description:
The task involves arranging pots and trees in such a way that their combined heights (pot height + tree height) are as close as possible across all pots. 
You are given the heights of n pots and n trees, 
and you need to find the minimum possible sum of the absolute differences between the combined heights of adjacent pots and trees.

Input:
Line 1: An integer n, representing the number of pots and trees (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000).
Line 2: n integers, p1, p2, ..., pn, representing the heights of the pots (1 ≤ pi ≤ 10000).
Line 3: n integers, t1, t2, ..., tn, representing the heights of the trees (1 ≤ ti ≤ 10000).

Output:
Line 1: An integer representing the minimum sum of the absolute differences between the combined heights of adjacent pots and trees.
